I am a researcher interested broadly in Computer Networking, Network
Security, and everything in between. Currently, I work on Networking and
Security projects at Facebook. Previously, I worked on Software-defined
Networking for the wide-are at Deutsche Telekom Laboratories in Mountain
View, CA, and before that, I co-founded Documents.Me. I went to
graduate school at Georgia Tech.
